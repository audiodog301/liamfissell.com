                <p>At seven in the morning yesterday, I found myself watching the sun rise. I had not slept in a good fourteen hours, and I despaired at any chance of fixing my turbulent sleep schedule before school started up again. I found solace in the motions of a morning routine: enjoying a leisurely mug of coffee, seeing my mom off when she left for work, exchanging Instagram memes with my Aunt Mary. Finally, against all odds, I got in my beat-up ’97 Pathfinder and began to drive. My phone precariously balanced between my car’s dashboard and steering column, I merged onto I-65, ready to seek out a coffee shop in Berry Hill.</p>
                <p>It was a comforting place, and I stayed a while for breakfast. Baristas chatted aimlessly, catching up with regulars after the holiday. Sitting at a rickety table, I went through a number of excellent lattes and an unremarkable burrito. Still, I remained restless. So, back to the car. Highway 70-S was fairly empty, and I found a great satisfaction in plodding southwest towards the Natchez Trace Parkway.</p>
